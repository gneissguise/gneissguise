## About Me

Greetings! I'm a **Senior Software Engineer** with **25 years of experience** architecting and building software systems. Throughout my career, I've developed a strong appreciation for solutions grounded in **simplicity, correctness, and efficiency**. My goal is always to contribute to robust, maintainable systems that deliver lasting value.

I approach technical challenges with a focused, analytical mindset and enjoy finding elegant solutions within complex domains. I believe strongly in the principles of **clean code** and leveraging practices like **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** to ensure quality and predictability throughout the development lifecycle. My focus is on building software that is not only functional but also well-structured and performant, prioritizing **low Big O complexity** where it matters most.

Leveraging decades of experience, I aim to contribute thoughtfully to technical discussions and collaborate effectively to achieve project goals.
